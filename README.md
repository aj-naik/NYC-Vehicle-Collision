# NYC-Vehicle-Collision
A Streamlit Dashboard for visualizing NYC Vehicular Collisions. Features:
- Using maps to check areas where most people are injured.
- Check how many collisions have occured during the day and at any time.
- Using Interactive maps one can see the location where accidents have occured and the user can also check the top 5 dangerous streets by the affected class. Namely 'Pedestrians', 'Cyclists' and 'Motorists'.

# Running it Locally:
- Clone the repo
- Run 'pip install streamlit' also install other dependencies like PyDeck, Plotly Express
- Open a Command Prompt in project directory and run 'streamlit run app.py'

# Data Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing was required as the data is a bit messy with quite a few missing values. So queried and removed missing values. Also converted column names and renamed a few columns for simplicity.

# Project History
My Second Streamlit data visualisation and second Streamlit app. Dataset is available on kaggle. Made this dashboard in August 2020 while learning about Data and ML deployment and since then have been using Streamlit as webapps using it are easy to build.
